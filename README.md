# GSET Robotics

PiStorms Robotics Competitions at the Governor's School of Engineering and Technology

Robots were built with LEGO MindStorms and Raspberry Pi and programmed with Python and PiStorms.

Rescue competition was to follow a line and locate a bomb within a house.

Sumo competition was to push another robot out of a circle.

Our color sensor malfunctioned in the rescue competition but we had the best sumo robot.
